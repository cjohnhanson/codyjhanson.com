My name is Cody. I'm a Senior Data Engineer at [Sprout Social](https://www.sproutsocial.com) in Chicago.

Before joining Arrive, I worked as a Systems Engineer at [PEAK6 Investments](https://www.peak6.com/) and as a Senior Data Engineer at [Arrive](https://www.arrive.com/) in Chicago.

Prior to becoming an engineer, I attended the University of Chicago as an  [Odyssey Scholar](https://odyssey.uchicago.edu/). During my time at UChicago, I worked as a tutor in the [Computer Science Instructional Laboratories](https://csil.cs.uchicago.edu/) where I led a small team of students who managed all of the labs' operations. I also worked as part of the teaching staff for multiple introductory level computer science courses. I received my BS in Computer Science and BA in Linguistics in June 2017.

In my free time I like to play guitar, bike around Chicago, and go for long walks with my dog, Loomis.
