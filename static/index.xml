      <description>My name is Cody. I&amp;rsquo;m a Senior Data Engineer at Sprout Social in Chicago.
Before joining Arrive, I worked as a Systems Engineer at PEAK6 Investments and as a Senior Data Engineer at Arrive in Chicago.
Prior to becoming an engineer, I attended the University of Chicago as an Odyssey Scholar. During my time at UChicago, I worked as a tutor in the Computer Science Instructional Laboratories where I led a small team of students who managed all of the labs&amp;rsquo; operations.</description>
