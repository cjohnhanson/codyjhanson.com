My name is Cody. I'm a Senior Data Engineer at [Arrive](https://www.arrive.com/) in Chicago.

Before joining Arrive, I worked as a Systems Engineer at [PEAK6 Investments](https://www.peak6.com/).

Prior to becoming an engineer, I attended the University of Chicago as an  [Odyssey Scholar](https://odyssey.uchicago.edu/). During my time at UChicago, I worked as a tutor in the [Computer Science Instructional Laboratories](https://csil.cs.uchicago.edu/) where I led a small team of students who managed all of the labs' operations. I also worked as part of the teaching staff for multiple introductory level computer science courses. I received my BS in Computer Science and BA in Linguistics in June 2017.

During the summer of 2016, I worked as a Digital Tools and Solutions Intern for Procter and Gamble in Cincinnati. Over the course of the summer, I worked with non-technical employees and developed custom business tools in Python to automate many of their most common tasks such as security policy compliance auditing, analysis of spending, and processing invoices from vendors. I also worked with P&G's nascent data science group to develop a tool to process big geospatial datasets using PySpark and Hive.

Professionally, I'm interested in applying DevOps principles to Big Data and Machine Learning contexts. Before being promoted to Senior Data Engineer, I worked as Arrive's sole DataOps Engineer. As part of that role, I built tooling for automated testing, deployment, and monitoring of analytics and data science workloads in AWS. I have significant experience with the following languages, tools, and frameworks (in order of decreasing expertise):

- Bash
- Golang
- Airflow
- PostgreSQL
- [Drone CI](https://drone.io/)
- Docker
- AWS (particularly ECS, EC2, S3, RDS, and Redshift)
- Jenkins
- Terraform
- Saltstack
- Ansible
- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)
- Vue.js
- React + Redux

In my free time I like to play guitar, bike around Chicago, and go for long walks with my dog, Loomis.
